In this project I used
    .html for general page layout 
    .css to style faq page and add responsivness
    .js to make the page interactive 
in js I used body selector to listen to clicks in document because I generated data dynamically with js 
I can't use Id selector so I listened event in complete document then I filtered only those which are closest to my selected class name then I used toggle property to remove or add hide css property
